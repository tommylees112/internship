    """Implementation of the ABC-Model.

    This function should be called via the .simulate() function of the ABCModel
    class and not directly. It is kept in a separate file for less confusion
    if anyone wants to inspect the actual model routine.

    The naming of the variables is kept as in the original publication [1].

    Args:
        prec: Numpy [t] array, which contains the precipitation input.
        initial_state: Scalar for the intial state of the storage.
        params: Numpy array of custom dtype, which contains the model parameter.

    Returns:
        qsim: Numpy [t] array with the simulated streamflow.
        storage: Numpy [t] array with the state of the storage of each timestep.
